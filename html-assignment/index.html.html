I came to Canada in the month of december and it was very old then for me. I live in a joint family consisting of my parents and grandparents. Also,I have two siblings a brother and a sister. I am a sportsperson and I have done boxing and weightlifting and secured silver medals in both of them. I have other hobbies such as reading books and playing football.</p>

The dogs are playful and very friendly. overall, my family is lovely and kind and I respect them from my heart.
