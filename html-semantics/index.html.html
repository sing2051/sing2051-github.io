    <p1> My name is Jaspreet singh and I am an international student from India. My hometown is Bathinda and it is a great city in the punjab state of India. I came to Canada in the month of december and it was very old then for me. I live in a joint family consisting of my parents and grandparents. Also,I have two siblings a brother and a sister. I am a sportsperson and I have done boxing and weightlifting and secured silver medals in both of them. I have other hobbies such as reading books and playing football.</p1>

They both work really hard and respect each other. we also have two pet dogs named jojo and chikoo, both are of pomerian breed. The dogs are playful and very friendly. overall, my family is lovely and kind and I respect them from my heart.
